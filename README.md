# bike-challenge
My first ML challenge on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/how-many-bikes

If you start with machine learning this project is perfect for you.
You will deal with:
- Scoring
- K-fold cross validation
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Linear Kernel
- Gaussian RDB Kernel
- Random Forest

This is my final work. To run this file you will need: Python 3 installed with Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Patsy and MatplotLib.
